## Some public repositories

Please, have a look at the repositories we have made publicly available:

* [FastOWM](https://github.com/PPMC-DAC/FastOWM) includes different implementations of the [OWM algorithm](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/12/7/1051) for CPU and GPU. Please, cite [this paper](https://authors.elsevier.com/sd/article/S1877-7503(24)00110-8) if you use these implementations for your own developments.
* [PaFESD Epileptic Seizure Detection](https://github.com/PPMC-DAC/PaFESD-Epileptic-Seizure-Detection) (work in progress).
* [Stencils application on FPGA with oneAPI](https://github.com/rasenjop/oneapi_fpga_stencil). Here we propose a simple running example (based on a stencil computation) that is iteratively improved using FPGA specific optimizations, such us loop unrolling, kernel replication, High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) modules exploitation and the Shift Register Pattern (SRP). To ease the implementation of these optimizations we leverage C++17 language features as metaprogramming and templates.
