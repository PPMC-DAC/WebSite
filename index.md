Our research group is particularly concerned about "productivity" in the context of high performance computing, or in other words, to achieve "performance without pain". From the computer architecture point of view we are in heterogeneous era where computing systems are composed of multicore or manycore CPUs along with accelerators like GPUs or FPGAs. To fully exploit these architectures is a challenge from the software point of view, because, to fully exploit them more development time and knowledge is required in comparison with the plain old sequential architectures. Our research goals are to find new tools and programming models to alleviate these new difficulties and challenges.

##### Research Interests

Parallel programming models, Scheduling for heterogeneous architectures, Parallel libraries (oneTBB), Parallel languages (DPC++, SYCL, oneAPI, Chapel, X10, UPC), Parallelizing/optimizing compilers, multiprocessor and heterogeneous (CPU+GPU+FPGA) architectures.
